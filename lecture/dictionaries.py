# dictionaries are python's version of objects in js
# useful for storing key-value pairs

# init an empty dict

d={}

# create a dict with two key-value pairs
e = {'foo': 12, 16: 'bar'}

#note for js users: there's no dot notation for accessing
# values in dicts in python
print(e["foo"])
print(e[16])

# loop through keys in dicts

    #print out both the key and the value
